# PMDR

PMDR is a productivity application based on the Pomodoro system. It not only allows the user to set Pomodoro sessions by inputting tasks, but it also allows the user to upload a picture of their to-do lists and create a Pomodoro session out of it, seamlessly integrating analog task lists to an automated Pomodoro timer system.
